-- Exercise 1: DVD Rental
-- Instructions
-- Get a list of all film languages.

-- Get a list of all films joined with their languages ‚Äì select the following details : film title, description, and language name. Try your query with different joins:
-- Get all films, even if they don‚Äôt have languages.
-- Get all languages, even if there are no films in those languages.

-- Create a new table called new_film with the following columns : id, name. Add some new films to the table.

-- Create a new table called customer_review, which will contain film reviews that customers will make.
-- Think about the DELETE constraint: if a film is deleted, its review should be automatically deleted.
-- It should have the following columns:
-- review_id ‚Äì a primary key, non null, auto-increment.
-- film_id ‚Äì references the new_film table. The film that is being reviewed.
-- language_id ‚Äì references the language table. What language the review is in.
-- title ‚Äì the title of the review.
-- score ‚Äì the rating of the review (1-10).
-- review_text ‚Äì the text of the review. No limit on the length.
-- last_update ‚Äì when the review was last updated.

-- Add 2 movie reviews. Make sure you link them to valid objects in the other tables.

-- Delete a film that has a review from the new_film table, what happens to the customer_review table?


-- üåü Exercise 2 : DVD Rental
-- Instructions
-- Use UPDATE to change the language of some films. Make sure that you use valid languages.

-- Which foreign keys (references) are defined for the customer table? How does this affect the way in which we INSERT into the customer table?

-- We created a new table called customer_review. Drop this table. Is this an easy step, or does it need extra checking?

-- Find out how many rentals are still outstanding (ie. have not been returned to the store yet).

-- Find the 30 most expensive movies which are outstanding (ie. have not been returned to the store yet)

-- Your friend is at the store, and decides to rent a movie. He knows he wants to see 4 movies, but he can‚Äôt remember their names. Can you help him find which movies he wants to rent?
-- The 1st film : The film is about a sumo wrestler, and one of the actors is Penelope Monroe.

-- The 2nd film : A short documentary (less than 1 hour long), rated ‚ÄúR‚Äù.

-- The 3rd film : A film that his friend Matthew Mahan rented. He paid over $4.00 for the rental, and he returned it between the 28th of July and the 1st of August, 2005.

-- The 4th film : His friend Matthew Mahan watched this film, as well. It had the word ‚Äúboat‚Äù in the title or description, and it looked like it was a very expensive DVD to replace.
