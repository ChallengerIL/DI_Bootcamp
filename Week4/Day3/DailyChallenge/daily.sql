-- Tables Relationships
-- You are going to practice tables relationships

-- Part I

-- Create 2 tables : Customer and Customer profile. They have a One to One relationship.

-- A customer can have only one profile, and a profile belongs to only one customer
-- The Customer table should have the columns : id, first_name, last_name NOT NULL
-- The Customer profile table should have the columns : id, isLoggedIn DEFAULT false (a Boolean), customer_id (a reference to the Customer table)

-- Insert those customers

-- John, Doe
-- Jerome, Lalu
-- Lea, Rive

-- Insert those customer profiles, use subqueries

-- John is loggedIn
-- Jerome is not logged in

-- Use the relevant types of Joins to display:

-- The first_name of the LoggedIn customers
-- All the customers first_name and isLoggedIn columns - even the customers those who donâ€™t have a profile.
-- The number of customers that are not LoggedIn


-- Part II:

-- Create a table named Book, with the columns : book_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, title NOT NULL, author NOT NULL

-- Insert those books :
-- Alice In Wonderland, Lewis Carroll
-- Harry Potter, J.K Rowling
-- To kill a mockingbird, Harper Lee

-- Create a table named Student, with the columns : student_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name NOT NULL UNIQUE, age. Make sure that the age is never bigger than 15 (Find an SQL method);

-- Insert those students:
-- John, 12
-- Lera, 11
-- Patrick, 10
-- Bob, 14

-- Create a table named Library, with the columns :
-- book_fk_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
-- student_id ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
-- borrowed_date
-- This table, is a junction table for a Many to Many relationship with the Book and Student tables : A student can borrow many books, and a book can be borrowed by many children
-- book_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column book_id from the Book table
-- student_fk_id is a Foreign Key representing the column student_id from the Student table
-- The pair of Foreign Keys is the Primary Key of the Junction Table

-- Add 4 records in the junction table, use subqueries.
-- the student named John, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 15/02/2022
-- the student named Bob, borrowed the book To kill a mockingbird on the 03/03/2021
-- the student named Lera, borrowed the book Alice In Wonderland on the 23/05/2021
-- the student named Bob, borrowed the book Harry Potter the on 12/08/2021

-- Display the data
-- Select all the columns from the junction table
-- Select the name of the student and the title of the borrowed books
-- Select the average age of the children, that borrowed the book Alice in Wonderland
-- Delete a student from the Student table, what happened in the junction table ?

-- Items & Orders
-- Create a table called product_orders and a table called items. You decide which fields should be in each table, although make sure the items table has a column called price.

-- There should be a one to many relationship between the product_orders table and the items table. An order can have many items, but an item can belong to only one order.

-- Create a function that returns the total price for a given order.

-- Bonus :
-- Create a table called users.
-- There should be a one to many relationship between the users table and the product_orders table.
-- Create a function that returns the total price for a given order of a given user.
