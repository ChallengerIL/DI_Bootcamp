# Python has many built-in functions.
# If you feel that you donâ€™t know how to properly implement them take a look at the python documentation online.
#
# 1. Write a program which prints the results of the following python built-in functions: abs(), int(), input().
# 2. Using the __doc__ dunder method create your own documentation which explains the execution of your code. Take a look at the doc method on google for help.
