# Description: In this exercise we will create a random sentence generator. We will do this by asking the user how long the sentence should be and then printing the generated sentence.
#
# Hint : The generated sentences do not have to make sense.
#
# 1. Download this word list
#
# 2. Save it in your development directory.
#
# 3. Create a function called get_words_from_file. This function should read the fileâ€™s content and return the words as a collection. What is the correct data type to store the words?
#
# 4. Create another function called get_random_sentence which takes a single parameter called length. The length parameter will be used to determine how many words the sentence should have. The function should:
#   - use the words list to get your random words.
#   - the amount of words should be the value of the length parameter.
#
# 5. Take the random words and create a sentence (using a python method), the sentence should be lower case.
#
# 6. Create a function called main which will:
#
#   1. Print a message explaining what the program does.
#
#   2. Ask the user how long they want the sentence to be. Acceptable values are: an integer between 2 and 20. Validate your data and test your validation!
#       - If the user inputs incorrect data, print an error message and end the program.
#       - If the user inputs correct data, run your code.
